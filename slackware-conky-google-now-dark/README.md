![screenshot](https://github.com/51114u9/conky-themes/raw/master/slackware-conky-google-now-dark/screenshot.jpg)

This style shows a semi-transparent panel to the right of the screen with the following information (in order):

- Weather based on ["conky google now"](http://satya164.deviantart.com/art/Conky-Google-Now-366545753) but optimized
- Indicator of the number of desktops and the current desktop
- Name of the distribution, OS and version
- Kernel version and computer architecture
- User name and hostname of the computer
- How long the system has been running (uptime)
- Memory RAM/SWAP: capacity used-total and percentage used
- Partition ROOT/DATA: capacity used-total and percentage used
- Battery percentage remaining and AC adapter status
- CPU: total usage percentage and temperature (all cores)
- For each kernel: speed used in Ghz and percentage
- Chart of CPU usage
- Information of the wireless/wired network card

Optimized for 1600x900 screen geometry, but can be adjusted by changing the settings `gap_x` using the formula:

`gap_x = display_width - 255px`

Enable the extension `Composite` in X11 and the `Composer` in your desktop (XFCE, KDE, etc.)

Use the font ["Open Sans Light"](http://www.opensans.com/)

Use [Tango Desktop Project! color palette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango_Desktop_Project#Palette)

Use the website http://checkip.dyndns.org/ to get the address public of the network cards

Enjoy!
